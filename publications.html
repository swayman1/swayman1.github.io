<p>I have grown up living in the most majestic place on earth and learned to fall
in love with nature at a young age. Anytime I was not in the rink, I was in the 
mountains, fishing on the river, or camping in the middle of no where. I have lived 
in Alaska, Colorado, South Dakota, and now Maine. All of these destinations were
chosen by my hockey path, but I learned to fall in love with each place on a personal
level and I feel fortunate to have partaken in the adventure I have this far! </p>
