<p><i>Welcome</i> to my hiking page!</p>
<h2>I have been fortunate to hike in some of the most epic National Parks in America. 
Here are some pictures of some of my favorite hikes!</h2>

<p>On the left, I am hiking the Chilkoot Trail in southern Alaska. On the right, my dog is

<p>Hiking is a big part of my life, it helps me reset my mind and gives me a break from 
reality. I plan to hike and adventure outside for as long as I possibly can to encounter
new experiences and make memories for a lifetime.  </p>
